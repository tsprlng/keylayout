What is this?
=============

It's a conveniently packaged implementation of my current 'favourite keyboard layout'. What exactly that means will probably change (or branch) over time – it'll always be a totally subjective choice based on my personal preferences though.

At the moment it's the first non-standard* one I've tried out, based on the [Workman layout](http://www.workmanlayout.com/). I've altered it to swap the useful shortcut keys (Z/XCV/QW) over to the right hand side, and also made some changes in the home row to more closely resemble the Dvorak layout I normally use. While making that change, I tried to pay attention to its design intentions (which seem like the most completely intuitive so far) and not screw them up totally.

(If I ever make weirder changes than that, I'll probably do a right-handed version too.)

*Dvorak is still 'standard' in terms of ease of installation -- even Windows supports it as a user preference, not just proper nerd desktops!


How did it get here?
====================

I started using the Dvorak layout for 'fun' on a slow Friday at work, and for some reason immediately committed myself to using it all the time. This made me embarrassingly slow at everything for a couple of weeks, but was useful as a way of forcing myself to touch-type, which I'd never managed to start doing properly before then – having to concentrate on remembering the layout also helped me pay closer attention to how I was misusing my hands.

(By the way, if you've got similar (always-looking-down, two-fingered) bad habits... I'd recommend not switching the keycaps around to match the layout. At least not until later, or maybe even never, unless it gets annoying when quickly seeking shortcut keys. If looking down is completely senseless, it's easier to quit!)

Anyway, that (eventually) worked well, and I like the layout quite a lot.


We're not using typewriters any more
------------------------------------

Dvorak's layout, and most others, are cunningly designed around factors like the frequency of particular letter sequences (often pairs), in an attempt to find minimal-effort key sequences for them and thus reduce overall typing effort.

There are differences in how designers define 'effort' though, which leads to differences in the end result.

For instance, Dvorak strongly prefers the home row, and seems to dislike all vertical/diagonal stretches quite equally. I think this probably made a lot of sense on typewriters, with a vertical 'hill face' of rows and the bouncy feel of long hammers.

On low-profile keyswitches, however, this approach doesn't feel right – for me, vertical stretches, especially on the non-little fingers, feel much easier than horizontal ones, and definitely require less arm tension. The same seems true on desktop keyboards, with any elevation.


The Workman layout
------------------

This seems like it might be worth trying because preference of stronger fingers and front-back movements is the main principle of its design. (Colemak is sort of halfway there, but not specifically based on that particular insight.) It also looks like it fixes the main problems I notice(d) myself having with Dvorak:

- The little-finger-stretch-up is correctly ranked as a terrible idea, so the reasonably common L and quote marks aren't whole-arm problems any more.

- E and O are the right way around... although I undid that anyway in the end.

- I seems more useful than U (ha haa)

We'll see...


My tweaks
---------

Literally all I've done so far is swap some keys to put some standard shortcuts on the right, because they're useful with a mouse and I use mine on the other side. (This is a coincidental reason I liked the Dvorak layout in the first place.)

In pedantic, purist principle, this is a stupid thing to care too much about since mice should hardly ever be the main interface anyway, but it's impractical and annoying to ignore it.

I've also (obviously!) standardized on a programmer's layout (symbols before numbers), and might swap some of those around too – similarly to 'Programmer's Dvorak', perhaps...

In the future I'm hoping to use extra modifiers/dead keys to eliminate moving around for symbols/numbers/backspace/forward-delete/return/esc/whatever as well. This should make minimal boards less irritating for occasional arithmetic, and maybe free up the number row for some more real shortcut keys. I haven't found my favourite arrangement yet, and this also seems like the sort of thing that could do with better desktop integration for feedback, so I'm leaving it for now...
